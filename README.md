# Investigation of Residual Stress and Dislocation Density in 316L Stainless Steel Fabricated via Directed Energy Deposition (DED)

## Overview
This project investigates the **residual stress** and **dislocation density** in 316L stainless steel fabricated using **Directed Energy Deposition (DED)**. The study focuses on understanding how these factors evolve at various elevated temperatures and their impact on the material's mechanical properties.

## Motivation
Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies, like **DED**, have revolutionized material fabrication by enabling the production of complex, geometrically intricate metal components with high precision. **316L stainless steel** is widely used in DED due to its:
- Excellent **corrosion resistance**
- High **mechanical strength**
- Suitability for **high-temperature applications**

### Challenges
Despite its advantages, the DED process introduces challenges, such as:
- Development of **residual stresses** due to rapid heating and cooling cycles, which can lead to warping, distortion, or failure.
- Increased **dislocation density**, affecting the material's strength and ductility.

## Objectives
The project aims to:
1. **Measure residual stress** and **estimate dislocation density** in 316L stainless steel using **X-ray Diffraction (XRD)** techniques.
2. Analyze how these microstructural characteristics change at various elevated temperatures.
3. Offer insights into optimizing the DED process to minimize residual stress and dislocation density.

## Methodology
- **Material**: 316L stainless steel samples fabricated using DED.
- **Technique**: X-ray Diffraction (XRD) for measuring residual stresses and dislocation density.
- **Temperature Range**: Analysis conducted at multiple elevated temperatures, including 400°C, 600°C, 800°C, 1000°C, and 1150°C.

## Key Findings
The study aims to provide:
- A deeper understanding of how temperature variations during the DED process affect the material’s microstructure and mechanical properties.
- Data to optimize the DED process for enhanced quality and reliability of 316L components.
- Insights into developing more effective post-processing techniques.

## Potential Applications
The findings can benefit industries such as:
- **Aerospace**
- **Automotive**
- **Biomedical**

By optimizing DED parameters, manufacturers can produce high-quality 316L components with minimal defects, improving their performance in critical applications.
