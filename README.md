The advancement of additive manufacturing technologies, such as Directed Energy Deposition (DED), has significantly transformed the field of material fabrication by enabling the production of complex, geometrically intricate metal components with high precision. Among the materials commonly used in DED, 316L stainless steel stands out due to its excellent corrosion resistance, mechanical strength, and suitability for high-temperature applications, making it a preferred choice for industries such as aerospace, automotive, and biomedical.

Despite its many advantages, the DED process introduces challenges related to the development of residual stresses and dislocation density within the material. These internal stresses and defects can greatly influence the material’s mechanical behaviour, particularly its performance under thermal cycling or at elevated temperatures. The formation of residual stresses, due to rapid heating and cooling during the DED process, can lead to warping, distortion, or even failure of components in critical applications. Similarly, dislocation density, which reflects the amount of crystal imperfections, can significantly affect the material’s strength and ductility.

This project aims to investigate the residual stress and dislocation density in 316L stainless steel fabricated via DED, with a particular focus on understanding how these factors evolve at various elevated temperatures. The research is centred around the application of X-ray Diffraction (XRD) techniques to measure the residual stresses and estimate the dislocation density at different stages of thermal exposure. By analysing these microstructural characteristics, the project seeks to offer insights into how temperature variations during the DED process influence the material’s mechanical properties, such as hardness, strength, and overall performance.

The study not only aims to contribute to the understanding of the fundamental mechanisms driving these changes but also seeks to provide valuable data for optimizing the DED process. By identifying the thermal conditions that lead to minimal residual stress and dislocation density, this research has the potential to enhance the quality and reliability of 316L stainless steel components produced through additive manufacturing. Additionally, the findings of this project could help inform the development of more effective post-processing techniques and better predict the material's behaviour in real-world applications.
